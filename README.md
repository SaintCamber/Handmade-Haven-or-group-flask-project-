## technical challenges - Sarah
The task given to Sarah Nodwell was to implement the reviews feature in Python, which required the use of various coding techniques and design patterns. As an experienced developer, Sarah decided to create the reviews component using a modular approach, breaking down the feature into multiple building blocks, each with a specific functionality.

This approach allowed the reviews component to be seamlessly integrated into other group member's components without causing any disruptions or conflicts. The modular design of the reviews component made it easier to maintain, debug, and update as necessary, while also improving its reusability and scalability.

To ensure that the reviews component met the required standards and specifications, Sarah made use of various Pythonic coding techniques, including object-oriented programming, functional programming, and exception handling. She also used best practices such as following the PEP 8 style guide and writing unit tests to ensure that the code was of high quality and error-free.

Once the reviews component was completed and tested, Sarah was pleased to see that it could be imported into other components using just one line of code, which was a significant achievement. This demonstrated the power and flexibility of the modular approach and how it could make the development process smoother, more efficient, and more enjoyable for all team members.

Overall, the implementation of the reviews component was a fun and challenging project that required technical expertise, creativity, and collaboration. It showcased the importance of using Pythonic and modular coding techniques to create robust and scalable software components that can be easily integrated into larger systems.
